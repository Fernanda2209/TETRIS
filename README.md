# TETRIS

# CONTEXT OF THE PROYECT

In order to have something cool in our portfolios and understand JavaScript at a medium level we are going to make a classic game called Tetris.

Besides, we don't know when one of our clients will want some gamer interaction, this little project can open a thousand possibilities that together
with the code will expand our creative frontiers.
